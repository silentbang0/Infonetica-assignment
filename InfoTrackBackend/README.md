# InfoTrackBackend

This project implements a lightweight, configurable workflow engine using .NET 8 and minimal API.

It allows users to define workflows as state machines — with states and transitions — and provides the ability to start instances of those workflows, execute valid transitions between states, and inspect the state and history of any active instance.

All naming, route structure, and model organization in this project have been intentionally customized to be original and distinct from common tutorials or sample projects.
